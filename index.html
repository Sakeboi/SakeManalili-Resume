        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music DestroyerðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first generation college student studying at University of California Riverside. I chose to attend school here and get a job nearby because unlike some, I need to work for every penny that goes towards my education.
        My mom always instilled me the importance of a further education and I am pursuing political science in hopes of contributing to my local community in impactful ways.
        Professionally, I have had not only work experience, but also research experience when it comes to assisting professors in the political science department with their various research papers.
        After my undergraduate studies I plan on taking a gap year and working to save up money for applying and attending law school in hopes of becoming a successful lawyer. 
          My first job was at Antioch ace hardware. There I provided excellent hardware support as well as made new keys, refilled propane, as well as build chainsaws for customers. There
        were multiple instances where I was entrusted with responsibility above my station when my manage consistently gave me the responsibility of closing up the entire store before I clocked out on my own.
        Overall it was a fulfilling first job, not only because of the fact that it was a close walk from my house at the time. This was essential to me due to the fact that I did not have my drivers license yet.
        Because of that I was forced to use my bike that I would bike from my house all the way to work until it was stolen one day and I bought a skateboard instead to replace the stolen bike.<br><br>

        My second job was at Yo Sushi Martinez where I was a server/cashier who helped bag orders for customers and bring their food out to them. 
        Other things that entailed the duties that I was required to perform was the fact that I had to talk to customers for very long periods of time even when I felt tired.
        I also was required to bring food out to the bar that was nearby which was illegal but they let me in regardless. <br><br>

        My most recent job was at Poke Bistro in Riverside where I worked as a poke bowl artist and made the best poke bowls ever. 
        There are many jobs that I would want, but none more so than to be a touring musician. It has always been one of my dreams to become a musician and play on stages for crowds of thousands.
        My favorite band of all time is Rage against the Machine and they have inspired me not only in the professional sense of wanting to pursue political science, but also musically in the band that I am currently in.
        Through our music we try to express our frustrations with the world in ways that only music can convey. 
        Overall, music makes up a big part of not only who I am as a person, but also who I aspire to become in the future.
